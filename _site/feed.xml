&lt;p&gt;This term has been more than I could have asked for or expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to Redeemer Bible Fellowship was the greatest joy of this term. It felt, in a sense, like returning home. I was exceedingly encouraged by this church, and am refreshed to serve back at home. At our church retreat, Pastor Johnson led a workshop on productivity and time management. He proposed that productivity is not defined by efficiency or getting things done, but rather by effectiveness - doing things that matter. It reminds me of Seth Godin’s quotation, “decide what really matters, and do it.” Ofttimes we tend to measure productivity by tangible accomplishments, such as grades or performance evaluations. However, some things I value - such as family, relationships, serving - are tougher to measure. This workshop led me to rethink my roles and how I am called to serve in each one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, halfway through the term, a friend disappeared off of Facebook. They say actions are more powerful than words; indeed, said friend’s action caused me to rethink my use of social media more than any article or statistic I’ve previously read. This rethinking led to rereading works by several authors from my studious high school days - from Cal Newport’s articles on deep work and deliberate practice to several blogs regarding exercise and health. Reincorporating routines and practices from such works was both nostalgic and refreshing. This time it was with a stronger sense of the fragility of human motivation, as well as the overwhelming importance of grit. It is all too easy to lose focus and go with the flow, and all too important to stay alert and aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, relationships matter. Or “relationships always matter”, as the LinkedIn alumni reunion slogan ran. My host, mentor, manager, and team at Google were awesome. I’ve learned much from their way of thinking through problems, focus on impact, and genuine passion for the work they do. I’ve met so many brilliant people, and am spurred on by their drive and diligence. I also had the opportunity to reconnect with previous mentors, managers, and coworkers. Most of all, I’ve enjoyed getting to know each person I’ve met - whether it be their background, their story, the books they enjoyed / learned from, their perspective, their passions and sometimes their quirks. It’s interesting how I always enter an internship looking to find and solve a technical challenge, and leave not only with that, but a more precious asset of relationships cultivated and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly but not least, I’m thankful for friends who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12580 with me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fly over and visit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tease, argue, joke&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tango - it takes five&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;share foobar adventures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make me clean my room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discuss coastline lengths&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let me crash countless times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;embark on 4D wonder woman movies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try to smile even though guppies don’t&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;call me out on passive aggressiveness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make time out of busy schedules to reunion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;play ensembles in the early hours of the morning
and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been an unbelievable four months, and I’m rejuvenated to return to family, school, research, and church life. In all things, in Christ alone and soli Deo gloria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">Gratitude.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflections on 2B Co-op</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/01/reflections-on-2b-coop.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflections on 2B Co-op" /><published>2017-01-01T05:53:27-05:00</published><updated>2017-01-01T05:53:27-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/01/01/reflections-on-2b-coop</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/01/01/reflections-on-2b-coop.html">&lt;p&gt;“The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.” Proverbs 16:1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first of our family bible study passages when I came home. Upon reflection of everything that transpired this year, I was once again struck how, in all things, God works and is sovereign. My right response is to trust in Him wholly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past four months, I interned at Bloomberg on the Listed Derivatives Real-Time team. My team manages the functions in the Bloomberg Professional Service that provide real-time monitoring of the option market. For my internship, I designed and implemented a system that reflected market sentiment on binary pharmaceutical events. This was accomplished using a quant model that used the option market and an assumption of a jump on the event date to provide sentiment analysis. I communicated with many people in different teams during this project, and have learned much from each of them. I had an amazing mentor always willing to guide and help, and a wonderful manager who encourages me to constantly be on the look for more interesting challenges. In many ways, it seems that I’ve seen another realm and set of perspectives of our world. A world whose crux is the market, and knowledge and analysis of events is value. A world I did not know became mine, and its once-foreign terms floating through the office – such as volatility, liquidity, options, ticker, arbitrage – later became words that held meaning to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York was also an adventure. At first, New York was a busy, dirty, unsafe city. Pedestrians rushed past each other, cars beeped, and the green line was a nightmare during rush hours. When dusk fell, every movement startled me out of my skin. Crossing streets felt equivalent to risking my life. However, as time went on, New York became home. I became the first to initiate street-crossing, a few subway stations became &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, and the newsboys’ “good morning” became a part of my life. I’ll remember the lady who sold me congee in a small shop in Flushing, Queens, the jolly pizza store owner in Brooklyn, the most kind waiter who welcomed us to fried chicken, the lady who fed us duck soup in k-town, and the kind security guards at 92Y and Bloomberg. In New York, I also experienced another world in arts. From the MET to MoMA, from skating to breakneck [ridge], from piano to singing, from Bach to Dvorak, from Eastman to NYPhil, from Chinese to German. It’s been unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m exceedingly thankful to the people who’ve shared NY with me. I’m thankful for my pastor at Redeemer, for the security guards who greet me in the morning, for the people who [sometimes] smile at me on the sidewalks, for the lady who let me squeeze into the subway car, for coworkers, for mentors, and for security guards at work and at ESB. I’m especially for the love and support of family and friends. Everything is more beautiful when shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot and experienced much grace this past year, and venture into the new year with thanksgivings and with a renewed spirit to fear, love, and serve my God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">“The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.” Proverbs 16:1</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflections on 2A Co-op</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/05/01/reflections-on-2a-coop.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflections on 2A Co-op" /><published>2016-05-01T09:29:54-04:00</published><updated>2016-05-01T09:29:54-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/05/01/reflections-on-2a-coop</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/05/01/reflections-on-2a-coop.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m at a loss of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess all there is to say is that God’s plans far exceed my plans, that His grace is greater than I can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term was characterized by challenge in many areas, but also immense support and growth. I’ve learned so much from each individual I have met this term and have also learned more to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At LinkedIn, I worked on the Distributed Graph Team, which aims to serve as LinkedIn’s global secondary index to answer cross-domain queries quickly. I explored and worked on a variety of projects, including development of an internal tool to help collect statistics on query time, research and experimentation of heuristic algorithms for graph partitioning, performance measurement and memory footprint of specific writes on specific relationships, implementation of key word arguments in our query language, and discussion on our representation of absence. I have an awesome mentor who is encouraging and always ready to help, and I’ve learned a lot from him about communication with others and how to approach problems and projects. I also have a great manager who always pushes me to consider why features are needed and to maintain a high-level view of my work—in other words, to not lose sight of the forest for the trees. We were also fortunate to have Kiran Prasad, VP Engineering, Asif Makhani, Senior Director of Engineering, and Jeff Weiner, CEO, share their experiences and insights with us. Kiran Prasad also recommended the book ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’ by Dale Carnegie. It’s a great book and impressed to me that understanding, appreciating, and learning from others is not to be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my biggest takeaways from the internship were:
To ask why. Don’t lose context on why we’re doing things, and keep the purpose in mind in all things.
To communicate. Over-communication is pretty much impossible. Talk to the right people as soon as possible because we work as a team.
To always care. Care about people. Don’t be afraid of taking initiative, smiling, and asking “how are you”. Everyone will be happier for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite parts of this term was living in the same apartment as the other LinkedInterns. Doing life together - whether it be running for the Caltrain in the morning, walking home at different speeds at night, or playing late night board games - makes mundane moments that much more special. I can honestly say that each one has an aspect that I need to learn from and emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the church I attended this term and the people in it. It has been a particular blessing to witness the lives of families in the church, and also how they are so ready to share their lives and to proclaim Christ. The support, encouragement and wisdom from my sisters in small group have also kept me grounded and more ready to walk in holiness each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has also been quite the musical internship. We discovered a music room at work, and through it, an amazing a capella group, InTune. Two of us auditioned and joined InTune, one of the luckiest things this term. Their kindness and love of singing has brightened our internship, and our weekly practice has become a highlight of my week. They are also incredibly talented and inspiring. Four of the interns also started our own band this term. Learning, singing, and practising songs together was a great experience. I am continually amazed by the wide set of talents within our small group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A random collection of other things we did include art galleries, barbecues, biking, board games, bosu, bouldering, brunch, fishbowl, hiking, kayaking, movies, road trips, skiing, succulents, wafels, and zumba. Too many memories that will reside in photos and even more that will just stay in our thoughts and lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned and grown much in the past four months and am immensely thankful for every person who has come into my life at this time. I’m excited to see what’s in store for the future, and rejuvenated to walk in and for Christ in all things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">I’m at a loss of words.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflections on 2A</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reflection/2015/12/31/reflections-on-2a.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflections on 2A" /><published>2015-12-31T10:14:48-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-31T10:14:48-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reflection/2015/12/31/reflections-on-2a</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reflection/2015/12/31/reflections-on-2a.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m still in disbelief that 2A is already over. It feels like I’ve just returned. At the same time, this summer also seems decades away. This term, I read an article that attributes the phenomenon of time speeding up to our perception of time in proportion to our lifespan. Each day is a smaller fraction of our lifespan than the day before. It’s an interesting concept. It’s also an okay excuse to repeat the cliche “time flies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning back to our cohort after our first work term feels reminiscent of visiting high school after a term at university: everything seems to be the same, but it feels different because we’ve changed and grown through our experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons that I relearned this summer was to think more highly of others and less of myself and also to truly appreciate the time I have with the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, through daily classes (or studying at home), projects, labs, and outings, I became closer with friends and learned much from their kindness, consideration, honesty, diligence, study techniques, and more. Through time with family (and watching Chinese TV shows with mom), I’ve learned more Chinese and learned by example what it means to love and serve one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a professor gave me the opportunity to work with him as an undergraduate research assistant (URA), for which I am very grateful. My professor is working on a cross-discipline project to help digital historians analyze data. He is remarkably energetic, kind, and creative. I was given the opportunity to build an API for historians to use with Spark, and learned much about collaboration, software engineering, and balance along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term I’ve spent less time on schoolwork than the previous terms. I’ve spent more time with friends, with family, and working on the URA. I think I’ve learned to enjoy life more and to worry less. However, I have also been less disciplined than before. Going forward, I need to be more focused on whatever is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new year, my chief end is still to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. By His grace, I hope to continually draw nearer to God, to walk in obedience before Him each moment, and to serve and love my neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am exceedingly thankful for God’s leading and abundant provision, for my always-supportive and loving family, and for each person whom I have known this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, ending this year and starting the next with doxology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
according to the power that worketh in us,
unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
world without end.
Amen.”

During this internship, I’ve broadened my horizons, learned significant lessons, and made awesome friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve changed from:
small town girl -&amp;gt; city girl
being unconfident in my abilities -&amp;gt; “I know very little, but I’ll figure it out”
making friends with people like me -&amp;gt; learning from and appreciating more people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to:
God for His goodness in all things
my family for their unending love
my team for their encouragement and code reviews
my mentor for his support and friendship
my roommates for their kindness and acceptance
pastors from church for their shepherding this summer
fellowship friends for their warm welcome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;friends who:
hike and explore
eat delicious food
learn Ukrainian folk dance early in the morning
share homegrown figs
share their passion about chocolate
collect me from 6th floor
teach me the ‘murican way of talking (and saying bacon ;) )
greet cheerfully every morning on the way to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This co-op term has been the most amazing experience ever, and I’ll treasure all the friends and memories I’ve made. Now, I’m back in Waterloo. It’s nice to be home with family, and I’m looking forward to what this term will bring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">It’s almost been a month since my internship at Square came to a close.

I have learned and grown in so many areas during these brief two months at work and away from the comfortable womb of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in SF a week prior to my start date to allow time to tour the city. Each day that week, I walked to the office and back. I also spent quite a bit of time exploring different areas of the city, including Bernal Heights, Embarcadero, Lower Haight, and Fisherman’s Wharf. Those travels reminded me of the lyrics of a song we sang in grade 8: “Just a small town girl/ Livin’ in a lonely world” (Journey, 1981). I was astonished by the poverty and hopelessness of the many people on the streets, and also overwhelmed by the tall buildings in the city. Recently, I’ve taken a few walks alone. San Francisco feels like home now, and I’m no longer scared to stop and take pictures. I’m friends with a cheery construction worker whom I see every morning on the way to work, and have gained an deeper appreciation for those who earn honest money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I doing at Square? I’m working on Settlements, which is the batch processing of payments. We process payments and run settlement jobs. I love my team, my manager, and my mentor. They are the most smart, diverse, and encouraging team that I could ever ask for, and I’m honoured to be working alongside them. I’ve been involved in sharding the database, designing the model to include taxes, and implementing file transmission. I’ve learned to write cleaner code, to navigate around git, and to think more critically about performance. I’ve also learned about distributed systems, software infrastructure design, and interesting tidbits about the JVM, and participated in debugging an intriguing time-related bug. Moreover, I’ve gained confidence in learning to understand and navigate systems. One of the highlights so far is knowing that I have contributed to the team in a meaningful way. Right now, I’m starting to design my “intern project” – cash reconciliation. There’s a lot to consider, but it’s going to be great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, I’ve also been blessed with the opportunity to connect with so many awesome people. My roommates are amazing. We’ve had some hilarious misunderstandings, and have also made delicious dinners. Our landlord is probably the most caring landlord one will ever meet. We make him dessert, and he gives us cake pans. I’ve also met some really kind, smart, and unique friends at Square, from UW, and from church. Each weekend, we have gone on outings and hikes that make daily life seem decades away. God’s creation is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been my first extended stay at a church outside of home. I’m truly thankful that God has brought me to this church – it’s grounded on God’s Word, and I’ve witnessed so much of His love through the pastors, uncles and aunts, and brothers and sisters that I have met. It’s really awesome to see how God’s people worship and glorify Him in different places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being my first internship, it has also been my first time tithing via check. After writing my first check full of thanksgiving and excitement, I placed it into the offering bag. The next week, I was told that I had forgotten to sign it. Which team am I working on at Square again? But now I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, coming to US, I opened a bank account at an American bank and used that for direct deposit, but connected the service with which I pay rent to my Canadian US dollar debit card. My third time paying rent, I overdrafted my account and incurred a $35 fine and a warning email saying that the bank account could be closed. It was quite frightening. Banks are like libraries – they don’t tell you your book is overdue until you owe a fine. I need to be more vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some random moments that are special to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;playing piano on the keyboard at work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;singing Amazing Grace in the BART station on 8:30am on Sundays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;walking around the neighbourhood on Sunday afternoon — we have the cutest grocery stores, the best view of the city and of the ocean, and the friendliest dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my midterm interview, my recruiter asked me what my thoughts were. I am nothing but thankful. Thankful to God for providing this opportunity and guiding throughout, to my parents for their continued love, to my mentor and team for their investment, and to my peers for being great friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">Last week, I had my midterm interview at Square.

As with last time, I am thankful for the many amazing people I have met, the new things I have learned, the support of family and friends, and the challenges that have driven me nearer to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that were special about this term:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;interviewing and job search&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meeting people (and Learning Night)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attending interesting talks (like Who To Follow by Jimmy Lin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning new things (photography, popping)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;returning to old hobbies (piano)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;failing (and learning from it (and doing really well in the end))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first year has been more that I could ever ask for. I still find it hard to believe that it has passed so quickly, but I’m sure that the next few years will be just as awesome, if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">First year SE has come to a close.

I cannot believe that another term has flown by. These three months have been even more challenging and fun than the previous term, and moreover, I have experienced many “firsts” and have learned a valuable lesson from one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, I applied to my first job, attended my first interview, and received my first offer. I also performed below average on my first midterm. The latter will hopefully also be a “last.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things stood out to me throughout the job search: the support and help from upper years, and the positive response from employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the job search experience started unofficially last September, when I made my first “Alice_Zhou_Resume.pdf.” A previous SE student offered to edit my resume, and I hesitantly sent it over. I received it with red pen marks all over it, and had a list of ~40 things to change. I have to say, that was quite humbling, and possibly the experience that aided me the most throughout JobMine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, an SE upper year also hosted a resume critique session, and several CS upper years helped with technical interviews. When thanking them, some demurred, saying that they didn’t do much. But it means a lot to me, and it certainly has made a big difference. Although I may not be able to repay the favour, I hope to be of help to future frosh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 20, I submitted my first 50 job applications. It was only after 22 rejections that I received my first interview. But from then, I received interviews from 12 different companies, 8 in Canada, and 4 in the US. Interviewing styles and times varied greatly, but overall, I met lots of awesome people and learned a lot. It turns out that I received offers from 10 companies, was rejected by one Canadian company, and was ranked by one US company. I cannot fathom how this happened, but am extremely grateful to every one who has helped me along the way, whether it be in critiquing, advice, support, or recommending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to share that the company with whom I had my first code camp, first coding challenge, and first interview, is also become my first employer! I am so excited that I will have the opportunity to work with awesome people at Square, and am looking forward to exploring San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the first job search experience was exciting and beyond imagination, the most important “first” this term was performing 4% below average on a midterm. “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,” and so, it is quite easy for me to make the bragging excuse that I spent too much time at the Tatham Centre. However, while that may be a factor in the below-par grade, it really doesn’t make a difference. I performed so poorly because I believed that I didn’t need to work hard, and that I could float by. Also, I was not as concentrated as last term, and did not do my utmost in this aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this experience, I learned firsthand that pride goeth before destruction, and complacency before backsliding. Also, I realized that balance will only become more and more difficult to attain. Perhaps balance is not the primary issue, but rather to be able to decide what is important, set appropriate goals, and focus entirely on what is at hand. No matter what the circumstances may be, it is critical to remember what my chief goal is, and whom I am serving. In this way, I learned more through this 9% drop in my calculus grade than any education I could possibly buy, and I will surely make good use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other things about this term. I’ve met so many awesome people, I can’t even count. I’ve also had to make some incredibly difficult decisions, and have grown tremendously from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finals are coming up, and I’m ready to give my utmost to His Highest in all that I do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">Last term, around this time, I launched this blog. I cannot believe that another term has flown by. These three months have been even more challenging and fun than the previous term, and moreover, I have experienced many “firsts” and have learned a valuable lesson from one of them.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Hi, I’m Alice” - A Few Thoughts on Interviewing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/02/12/hi-im-alice-a-few-thoughts-on-interviewing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Hi, I'm Alice&quot; - A Few Thoughts on Interviewing" /><published>2015-02-12T08:38:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-12T08:38:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2015/02/12/hi-im-alice-a-few-thoughts-on-interviewing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2015/02/12/hi-im-alice-a-few-thoughts-on-interviewing.html">&lt;p&gt;On February 3, 2015, I climbed up the Tatham Centre staircase and walked in to my first SWE interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the advice and help of several wonderful upper-years, I was quite scared. I also had no idea how to “sell myself”, and still shy away each time I hear that phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entering the room, I said, “Hi, I’m Alice,” and we started coding. Contrary to expectations, it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, that was the only entirely technical interview I had, and many have been predominantly behavioural. But after the first interview, I discovered that interviewers are not out to get you, but rather are looking for someone they can work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have learned so much from each interview and interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that it’s okay to say “I don’t know.” I’ve learned of the importance of taking advantage of university time to take challenging courses, being self-evaluative yet confident, being accountable in all things, always asking questions and listening, and enjoying university life. On the technical side, I’ve learned about “shift-d” in vim, var_arg in C, storing useful data, removing redundant data, and the “transient” keyword in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my interviewers, thanks for sharing your thoughts, I have really enjoyed hearing about what you’re working on, and how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for that first interview, I somehow passed it, and am looking forward to the second round next week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">On February 3, 2015, I climbed up the Tatham Centre staircase and walked in to my first SWE interview.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflections on 1A</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/12/19/reflections-on-1a.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflections on 1A" /><published>2014-12-19T09:29:40-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-19T09:29:40-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2014/12/19/reflections-on-1a</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2014/12/19/reflections-on-1a.html">&lt;p&gt;This week, I wrote my last exam for 1A Software Engineering. I am thankful for the many amazing people I have met, the new things I have learned, and the support of family and friends. Further, I am thankful for the challenges that have driven me nearer to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, I gained a deeper appreciation for the parable of the man building a house in Matthew 7:24-27. Building a house is a huge project, but even houses are built brick by brick. One’s house is not tested until the day that the rains descend, the floods come, and the winds blow. However, when they come, the house that is built upon actions that find their foundation in Christ will stand firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has caused me to rethink the way that I approach each step of my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to academics, I suppose one could see final exams as the rain, floods, and winds. This term, I planned out final exam review such that I was finished studying one day before each respective exam. This worked, but I found that some review was unnecessary if I had taken more care with internalizing the information throughout the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next term, I plan to bring one binder with only blank paper and assignments to school, so that I must do assignments without referencing lecture notes. At night, when transferring the day’s notes to their respective binders, I will review the notes by lecturing each note to an imaginary class, even if I feel that I know the information. Also, time limit for studying is still 9:30pm, and on weekdays only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am thankful for this term, and looking forward to the new term and the new experiences, such as interviews and coop, that will come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alice Ran Zhou</name></author><summary type="html">This week, I wrote my last exam for 1A Software Engineering.
