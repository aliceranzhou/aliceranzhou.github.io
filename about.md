Hi, I'm Alice! I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Waterloo (estimated 2019). I have worked at Square, Linkedin, Bloomberg, and Google and enjoy delving deeper into topics through research opportunities.

This blog is mainly a collection of reflections from my experiences at school and on co-op terms.

Some things I've been exploring:
- relearning [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujd1rMjPgsE&list=PLE_tBD2JQ8q2-Ij6G3C15i_3gcvL0u_CI)
- how to do [deep work](http://calnewport.com)
- exercise and health
- reading more, both in academics and not (always open for recommendations)
- hiking and travelling
- investing in quality family time (find my brother [here](https://www.matthewyangzhou.com)!)
