Hi, I'm Alice! I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Waterloo (estimated 2018). I have worked at Square, Linkedin, Bloomberg, and Google and enjoy delving deeper into topics through research opportunities.

This blog is mainly a collection of reflections, starting from the beginning of university.

Some things I've been exploring:
- relearning [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujd1rMjPgsE&list=PLE_tBD2JQ8q2-Ij6G3C15i_3gcvL0u_CI)
- how to do [deep work](http://calnewport.com)
- exercise, food, dance
- investment and economy
- reading (always open for recommendations!)
- hiking, nature, travel
- investing in quality family time (find my brother [here](https://www.matthewyangzhou.com)!)
