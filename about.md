Hi, I'm Alice! I'm a 2018 Computer Science grad from the University of Waterloo. I currently work on display ads serving infrastructure at Google.

This blog is mainly a collection of reflections, starting from the beginning of university.

Some things I've been exploring:
- relearning [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujd1rMjPgsE&list=PLE_tBD2JQ8q2-Ij6G3C15i_3gcvL0u_CI)
- how to do [deep work](http://calnewport.com)
- exercise, food, dance
- investment and economy
- reading (always open for recommendations!)
- hiking, nature, travel
- investing in quality family time (find my brother [here](https://www.matthewyangzhou.com)!)

Note: the opinions expressed on this blog are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
