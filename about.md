Hi, I'm Alice! I'm a 2018 Computer Science grad from the University of Waterloo. I currently work on display ads serving infrastructure at Google.

This blog is mainly a collection of reflections, starting from the beginning of university.

Note: the opinions expressed on this blog are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
