Hi, I'm Alice! I'm a wife, homemaker, and a software engineer working on ads serving infrastructure at Google.

This blog is mainly a collection of reflections, starting from the beginning of university.

Note: the opinions expressed on this blog are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
