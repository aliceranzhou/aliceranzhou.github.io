_Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,  
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;  
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,  
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!_  

Continually I am reminded of my sinfulness and how prone my heart is to wander. But I am assured even of God's faithfulness, and how abundantly He sheds love and grace upon me.   
_And my song shall ever be: How marvelous! How wonderful! Is my Savior's love for me._

This term has been truly one of great blessing, and each one in such unexpected ways.

School.  
This term I took CS 486 (Artificial Intelligence), CS 698 (Machine Learning), CS 343 (Concurrency), CS 466 (Algorithms Design and Analysis), piano studio, and chamber ensemble. Each term I tend to overload and decide to take a lighter load the next term, but it never seems to happen. “Next time!”  I was unable to complete the undergraduate research assistantship because of course workloads. Thankfully my professor was understanding, but it was a well-needed wake-up call that I have limits.

Piano.  
I had no idea what to expect from piano studio and chamber ensemble. However, the weekly piano and chamber lessons became some of my most treasured hours of the week. My piano teacher is the kindest, most encouraging teacher. Her teaching not only showed her love for music, but even more her genuine care for people. I played also for her mother - and truly like mother like daughter. I strive towards that gentleness of spirit and heart to serve others. Ensemble was just amazing. From the first practice where I was instructed to “play louder” when I was already playing with every ounce of energy my body had, to the interim ones where our director danced to emphasize the spirit of the music, to the last concert where we shared the fruits of the term with friends and family. Music is a blessing to the soul.

Internship.  
This term I wanted to return to Mountain View, so I did not touch WaterlooWorks. The period of waiting, when all of my classmates were getting interviews and going through interviews, was trying. I guess all periods of waiting can be. But thanks be to God! By His grace, and by the kindness of my previous manager, I was matched to a team that I am greatly under-qualified for, and am excited to learn and explore!

Fellowship.  
Fellowship has been amazing. In times past, I found it difficult to relate to brothers and sisters in our fellowship. Most of them grew up in China and came here afterwards, and though I had a heart to love and serve them, I could not do that which I willed. Through storms and through prayer, that has changed. Truly, culture can differ, but we are united in Christ. We love each other because God loved us, and true friendships are founded firstly on our covenant with the Lord.  

_There is one body, and one Spirit,  
even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;  
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all,   
who is above all, and through all, and in you all._

Prayer.  
My pastor came over during Thanksgiving weekend, and during the conversation, he mentioned the movie 'War Room'. The next day, we borrowed it from the library and watched it at home. I won’t spoil the movie, but suffice to say, it reminded me of the necessity and blessing of prayer.  

_And what a privilege to carry  
Everything to God in prayer_  

_Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus._  

And this has been the greatest blessing of the term. Truly what a privilege it is to pray, and to intercede for others in prayer.

Pneumonia.  
I got sick in the last month of the term. The last time I sick before this was in high school (barring a short time of coughing in Fall 2016). That week I had CS 343, CS 466, CS 489, and CS 486 homework all due. I was only able to do work for the first two and a half days of sickness. God is gracious and I was more productive in those first days than ever before. However, the remaining days of that week were painful, and truly a reminder of my frailty and the preciousness of health. It's times like those where _we rejoice in sufferings_ gets put to the test. Yes, I know that _God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to His purpose_, but I am currently in pain and it is hard to rejoice, and to be confident that this is life. Truly _my flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever._ A surprising blessing of the term was the amount of time spent in reflection and prayer. Further I was reminded of the love of my family, pastors, and brothers and sisters in Christ. Mom made me pear soup when I could not stomach food, Dad took me to the hospital at crazy hours of the night (day?), Matthew helped me get things from upstairs when I had no energy, pastors and friends prayed for me. In these ways and more, I was showered with love, and have all the more incentive to serve those in my life whatever way I can.

Exams.  
Exams are still ongoing, and they end next Tuesday. Then I have an entire month at home before the next co-op term starts. Times like this are few and precious now. I am looking forward to the next term. Many things are uncertain, but I _put trust in the Lord, that I may declare all His works._ He walks with me, and will guide my path, so my duty is but to trust and obey.

_Many things about tomorrow  
I don't seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand_
