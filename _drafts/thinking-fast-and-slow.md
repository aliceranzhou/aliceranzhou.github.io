title: "Reflections upon Thinking Fast and Slow"
---

In David Kahneman's book "Thinking Fast and Slow", he introduces three pairs of opposing systems: System 1 and System 2, Utility theory and Prospect theory, and the experiencing self vs the remembering self. For a concise summary of the book, see Paul Minor's [book summary](https://paulminors.com/thinking-fast-slow-book-summary-pdf/).

This post will document 10 ideas that stood out to me.

Personifying the two types of thinking that occur as System 1 and System 2, Kahneman discusses the role of both systems in our decision-making processes. System 1 operates automatically and involuntarily, while System 2 handles effortful, concentrated thinking.

**Point 1**. Intellectual thinking can lead to loss of self control. Positivity can cure this.

System 2 is in charge of both intense thinking and self control. When much concentrated thinking occurs, glucose levels may decrease and result in ego depletion, making self-control more difficult. This effect can be somewhat alleviated by intake of glucose. Personally, glucose intake conflicts with other goals that require self control (i.e. weight loss). Doing more research, a study by Tice et. al. published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology showed that positive mood can also alleviate the effect of ego depletion. Always good to be positive!

**Point 2**. The halo effect is real.

An impression in one area easily permeates to the overall impression of a person/thing/subject. This is a useful thing in many judgment calls - always try to decentralize judgments so that the halo effect is minimized.

**Point 3**. A small sample is synonymous to an extreme sample.

A small sample will be more extreme. Smaller schools are more variant in performance.

**Point 4**. We equate easiness with importance.

The availability effect states that something easily retrieved will seem more import. For example, if we've heard of terrorism recently, we will be more aware of terrorist events.

**Point 5**. What you anchor on is important.

Anchoring refers to a comparison to the value. Given a certain anchor value, people tend to shift the anchor until it is just inside the acceptable range. This reminds me of the childhood game in which you tell a friend to look away and tell you when you've reached their elbow crease. Most people say stop far before. When judging, rather than anchoring on given representations, it's important to learn appropriate base rates and anchor judgment upon those.

**Point 6**. Cause and effect is not always immediate.

We like to know why things occur, and sometimes attribute cause and effect inappropriately. For example, let's say we see a fit person eat chocolate. Then the cause-effect may be "eating chocolate is healthy". This seems silly but is not too far off. Or a student performs below usual and the teacher yells at the student. The next time the student performs at or above normal behaviour. Then we say "yelling helps". In this example, regression to the mean occurs. When something on an extreme occurs, the next event is likely to be either closer to the mean or on the other extreme.

This disheartened me at first thought. "Regression to the mean? I'll never improve". But rather, the goal of practising is to move the mean. Sure, case by case we will regress to the mean, but if we improve, then the mean will shift.

**Point 7**. We overestimate our memory and ability.

We have an imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge. Our present state will flow into our memory of prior states. 
One of the consequences is that we underestimate the amount of surprise we felt at an unlikely event. Then, if someone made a choice that lead to a undesired outcome, we often accuse the decision maker of not seeing "clear" signs. We will tend to assess the quality of decisions by the outcome rather than by process. Often there is unpredictability involved in any decision. Even given the best sequence of decisions, and unlikely and unwanted outcome may occur. And successes are not always the result of perfect decisions.

**Point 8**. We overestimate experts.

Often, statistics can perform better than experts. Experts try to be clever and "think outside of the box". Complexity may work in he odd case, but simple combinations of features are better. Formulas are consistent and do not make biased judgments.

**Point 9**. We overestimate ourselves.

We judge things different depending on whether we are inside or outside of a situation. Often we make more reasonable estimates of success or deadlines for an outside situation than that of an situation of which we are part. To remedy this, one should construct an outside view of a situation and forecast based on that view. This is coined as reference class forecasting.

**Point 10**. We dislike loss.

He undergoes a discussion of prospect theory that partially went over my head. What remains is that we react to losses more strongly than a corresponding gain. This is known as loss aversion. This can also seen in the endowment effect, in which we are prone to keep that which we have instead of trading it for something else.

**Point 11**. Memory over experience: why I take pictures.

Kahneman characterises the two different states of mind as the experiencing self and the remembering self. For example, the experiencing self experiences pain at the moment, while the remembering self retains the memory of pain. In an experiment they performed, they also find that duration is forgotten, but instead the last few moments of an experience is most remembered. Always make the ending good. End practices well. End study sessions confidently. End days at peace.
