title: "Four Years, Uncountable Stories"
---

Driving to work in the morning has now become an action that does not require thought. It’s hard to believe that only four months ago I was frantically studying for a quantum mechanics exam to finish undergrad--and even more, that four years ago I was just starting at the University of Waterloo (UW).

Postulate 1 of quantum mechanics says that a ket comprehensively represents all the information there is to know about a physical state. There is no proverbial ket that describes any period of time; indeed, there are so many different threads that weave together to form an overall story.

Here are some of the threads of my time as a student at UW.

###Studies
In high school, I thought I was going to Waterloo to learn how to code.

Instead, here is a short compilation of some adventures:
* Fiddling with a Scribbler robot to make it play music
* Solving problems related to a turtle sitting on a car driving on a wedge
* Using right hand rule during exams to make sense of electromagnetics
* Messing up on calculations in nodal and mesh analysis
* Diagonalizing matrices and appreciating eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Trembling during short speeches and skits about housing
* Collecting garbage with my baby compiler
* Struggling through Fourier analysis and recalling DRSA days
* Trying to schedule a fair traffic lights and writing low level functions
* Making Turing machines run Turing machines to prove computational complexity
* Big data hype - running MapReduce programs
* Relearning optimization for ML proofs and trying to classify cats from non-cats
* Scheduling jobs on machines and proving optimality
* Drawing graphs in the air while doing graph theory proofs
* Writing a concurrent vending machines system
* Hacking a website in security class 
* Performing music again for Luther Village residents
* Kets and quantum and matrix rotations

To be more data driven, here are some term averages. First year saw some marks of 100, second year saw some final exam marks near 60. Now, none of the numbers are relevant.

Each term had its unique challenges and changes. 1A to 2B were spent in Software Engineering. I discovered combinatorics and optimization courses, and our class also had a non-ideal experience with MSCI 261. To allow more course flexibility, and in order to take a C&O minor, I switched to CS in third year. This choice later unexpectedly allowed me to graduate in just 7 terms.

###Job search
Waterloo’s co-op program has become world renown, and I think not without reason. The opportunities for growth throughout the process are invaluable.

Here’s a snippet from my first ever resume critique.

Upper years reached out to help with interview skills. I needed to learn how to shake hands and introduce myself.

I learned data structures and algorithms through reading Cracking the Coding Interview and working through interview problems with interviewers.

First [interviews](
https://www.aliceranzhou.com/2015/02/12/hi-im-alice-a-few-thoughts-on-interviewing.html) came and passed. Interviews during midterm season became a recurring theme.

Later on, Shine started conducting mock interviews, and Rudi and I joined. Here’s a great [write-up](http://digitalfreepen.com/2017/08/03/guide-mock-interviews.html) from Rudi.

The last job search during my time at Waterloo was for full-time positions. Although probably the least prepared for (graduating early was a last-minute decision), the many interviews beforehand were of much benefit. In the end, interviews become a fun experience to learn more about a company and meet people. 

###Co-op
Now for the co-ops themselves.

I am deeply thankful for each mentor I’ve had, and the amazing managers and coworkers I’ve had the opportunity to work alongside.

For brevity, here are some of the highlights of my work terms: first year saw lots of pair programming, database sharding, and delicious food. I wrote a transaction failure detection system that later paged our TL at 4am. Second year, I researched graph partitioning algorithms, and also added to our graph query language. I also learned about quantitative models from an expert. Third year I learned about the ads ecosystem. Fourth year I trained an embedding model and watching the model learn relationships.

The most rewarding experience was building relationships with awesome people. Thank you to all who believed in me and gave opportunities, gave valuable insights and advice, opened my mindset and opened doors, and honestly shaped my future trajectory. 

Co-ops also meant adventures. New friends, breathtaking hikes, beautiful music, delicious dumplings, memorable runs, shared food.

###Research
In first year, I attended some talks by our Computer Science department. You never know where things lead. I followed up after a particularly interesting talk, and was given the opportunity to take a big data course and run jobs on a Hadoop cluster.

These are my notes from the talk where it all started.

I was further given the opportunity to work on digital archives and graph databases, learning much about research in the process.

Our graph database paper was accepted to GRADES, and we went to Chicago for SIGMOD!

After these things, I started an Accelerated Masters in Computer Science focusing on Machine Learning, and spent a term on Google’s Research and Machine Intelligence team working on conversational recommendations.

###Family
I lived somewhat like a high school student. This was me every afternoon: “爸爸可以来接我吗？在垃圾桶，爱你！” Here is that infamous garbage can.

But very seriously, my family’s love and support is such a blessing.

###Church
Co-ops in different cities brought me in and out of my home church and to other churches. I am very much encouraged by God’s family.

Commutes to church varied from sunrise ferries to sunset walks.

###Grace
So many times along the way I wandered from God. So many times I did silly things that hurt people and myself. Yet God’s mercy reaches even unto me. Not only did He preserve me, He brought wholeness out of brokenness.

Through all these threads, grace is a recurring theme. Something I’ve learned is that nothing is under my control -- even good things often come as surprising, and often by others showing grace. 

Each drive to work is not possible had not these people supported.
