<p>First year SE has come to a close. As with last time, I am thankful for the many amazing people I have met, the new things I have learned, the support of family and friends, and the challenges that have driven me nearer to God.</p>

<p>Things that were special about this term:</p>
<ul>
  <li>interviewing and job search</li>
  <li>meeting people (and Learning Night)</li>
  <li>attending interesting talks (like Who To Follow by Jimmy Lin)</li>
  <li>learning new things (photography, popping)</li>
  <li>returning to old hobbies (piano)</li>
  <li>failing (and learning from it (and doing really well in the end))</li>
</ul>

<p>This first year has been more that I could ever ask for. I still find it hard to believe that it has passed so quickly, but Iâ€™m sure that the next few years will be just as awesome, if not more so.</p>
