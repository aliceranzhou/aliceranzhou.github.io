<p>I’m still in disbelief that 2A is already over. It feels like I’ve just returned. At the same time, this summer also seems decades away. This term, I read an article that attributes the phenomenon of time speeding up to our perception of time in proportion to our lifespan. Each day is a smaller fraction of our lifespan than the day before. It’s an interesting concept. It’s also an okay excuse to repeat the cliche “time flies”.</p>

<p>Returning back to our cohort after our first work term feels reminiscent of visiting high school after a term at university: everything seems to be the same, but it feels different because we’ve changed and grown through our experiences.</p>

<p>One of the lessons that I relearned this summer was to think more highly of others and less of myself and also to truly appreciate the time I have with the people around me.</p>

<p>This term, through daily classes (or studying at home), projects, labs, and outings, I became closer with friends and learned much from their kindness, consideration, honesty, diligence, study techniques, and more. Through time with family (and watching Chinese TV shows with mom), I’ve learned more Chinese and learned by example what it means to love and serve one another.</p>

<p>Further, a professor gave me the opportunity to work with him as an undergraduate research assistant (URA), for which I am very grateful. My professor is working on a cross-discipline project to help digital historians analyze data. He is remarkably energetic, kind, and creative. I was given the opportunity to build an API for historians to use with Spark, and learned much about collaboration, software engineering, and balance along the way.</p>

<p>This term I’ve spent less time on schoolwork than the previous terms. I’ve spent more time with friends, with family, and working on the URA. I think I’ve learned to enjoy life more and to worry less. However, I have also been less disciplined than before. Going forward, I need to be more focused on whatever is at hand.</p>

<p>In the new year, my chief end is still to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. By His grace, I hope to continually draw nearer to God, to walk in obedience before Him each moment, and to serve and love my neighbour.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly thankful for God’s leading and abundant provision, for my always-supportive and loving family, and for each person whom I have known this year.</p>

<p>Now, ending this year and starting the next with doxology:</p>

<p>“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
according to the power that worketh in us,
unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
world without end.
Amen.”
(Ephesians 3:20-21, KJV)</p>
