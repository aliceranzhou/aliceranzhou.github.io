<p>It’s almost been a month since my internship at Square came to a close. During this internship, I’ve broadened my horizons, learned significant lessons, and made awesome friends.</p>

<p>I’ve changed from:
small town girl -&gt; city girl
being unconfident in my abilities -&gt; “I know very little, but I’ll figure it out”
making friends with people like me -&gt; learning from and appreciating more people</p>

<p>I am grateful to:
God for His goodness in all things
my family for their unending love
my team for their encouragement and code reviews
my mentor for his support and friendship
my roommates for their kindness and acceptance
pastors from church for their shepherding this summer
fellowship friends for their warm welcome</p>

<p>friends who:
hike and explore
eat delicious food
learn Ukrainian folk dance early in the morning
share homegrown figs
share their passion about chocolate
collect me from 6th floor
teach me the ‘murican way of talking (and saying bacon ;) )
greet cheerfully every morning on the way to work</p>

<p>This co-op term has been the most amazing experience ever, and I’ll treasure all the friends and memories I’ve made. Now, I’m back in Waterloo. It’s nice to be home with family, and I’m looking forward to what this term will bring.</p>
