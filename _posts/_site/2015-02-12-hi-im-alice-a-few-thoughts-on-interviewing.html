<p>On February 3, 2015, I climbed up the Tatham Centre staircase and walked in to my first SWE interview.</p>

<p>Even with the advice and help of several wonderful upper-years, I was quite scared. I also had no idea how to “sell myself”, and still shy away each time I hear that phrase.</p>

<p>Upon entering the room, I said, “Hi, I’m Alice,” and we started coding. Contrary to expectations, it was awesome.</p>

<p>Granted, that was the only entirely technical interview I had, and many have been predominantly behavioural. But after the first interview, I discovered that interviewers are not out to get you, but rather are looking for someone they can work with.</p>

<p>Since then, I have learned so much from each interview and interviewer.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that it’s okay to say “I don’t know.” I’ve learned of the importance of taking advantage of university time to take challenging courses, being self-evaluative yet confident, being accountable in all things, always asking questions and listening, and enjoying university life. On the technical side, I’ve learned about “shift-d” in vim, var_arg in C, storing useful data, removing redundant data, and the “transient” keyword in Java.</p>

<p>To my interviewers, thanks for sharing your thoughts, I have really enjoyed hearing about what you’re working on, and how you got there.</p>

<p>As for that first interview, I somehow passed it, and am looking forward to the second round next week.</p>
