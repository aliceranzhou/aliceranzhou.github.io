This week, I wrote my last exam for 1A Software Engineering. I am thankful for the many amazing people I have met, the new things I have learned, and the support of family and friends. Further, I am thankful for the challenges that have driven me nearer to God.

This term, I gained a deeper appreciation for the parable of the man building a house in Matthew 7:24-27. Building a house is a huge project, but even houses are built brick by brick. One’s house is not tested until the day that the rains descend, the floods come, and the winds blow. However, when they come, the house that is built upon actions that find their foundation in Christ will stand firm. 

This has caused me to rethink the way that I approach each step of my day.

With regards to academics, I suppose one could see final exams as the rain, floods, and winds. This term, I planned out final exam review such that I was finished studying one day before each respective exam. This worked, but I found that some review was unnecessary if I had taken more care with internalizing the information throughout the term.

Next term, I plan to bring one binder with only blank paper and assignments to school, so that I must do assignments without referencing lecture notes. At night, when transferring the day’s notes to their respective binders, I will review the notes by lecturing each note to an imaginary class, even if I feel that I know the information. Also, time limit for studying is still 9:30pm, and on weekdays only.

In summary, I am thankful for this term, and looking forward to the new term and the new experiences, such as interviews and coop, that will come with it. 

For now, I wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!
