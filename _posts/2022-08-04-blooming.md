A year ago we said “I do”  
And started on our journey true  
To build a home upon our Rock  
By grace and faith each day to walk  

Our Shepherd led us through each trial  
Midst battles fierce and foes hostile  
We learned to turn from fears and woes  
To trust in Him who joy bestows   

In winter were we in much prayer  
The Lord to grant us a sweet heir  
Through hopeful nights now but a haze  
He heard our cries and brought forth praise  

Oh our dear girl we love you so  
By grace we’ll lead you Him to know  
May God uphold you from the womb  
And make you in His love to bloom
